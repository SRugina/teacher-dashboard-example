## Scenario:

When new students arrive at Tree Road School, they are assigned:

* a unique ID number
* a tutor group
* a unique school email address

A tutor group contains approximately 25 male and female students.

Mr Leeman is a form tutor and wants a simple computer system to manage his tutor group.

Mr Leeman wants to be able to have a user friendly interface that allows him to log into the system and carry out the necessary administration.

The details of the students that Mr Leeman needs are:

* unique ID number
* surname
* forename
* date of birth
* home address
* home phone number
* gender
* tutor group
* unique school email address

Analyse the requirements for this system and design, develop, test and evaluate a program that allows Mr Leeman to:

1. log in with a username and password.
2. access a menu system
3. enter and store the students details
4. log out
5. retrieve and display the details of any student when Mr Leeman enters the student's unique ID number.
6. create at least three different reports that Mr Leeman might need, and describe how he would use each one
7. produce these reports when selected from a menu.
